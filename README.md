# Reality Command: A Foundational Prototype

Welcome to Reality Command, a conceptual prototype that reimagines the future of software development. This application is more than just a tool; it's an exploration into a new medium for creation, blending a powerful AI-driven build engine with an immersive, holographic interface.

Our goal was not to build a better version of an existing tool, but to ask: What if you could sculpt an application as if it were a physical object? What if you could build not just with code, but with reality itself?

This prototype is our first answer to those questions.

## Core Concepts

The application is built around a few key philosophical and functional concepts:

### 1. The Reality Command Interface (RCI)

This is your connection to the creative engine. The text-based command interface at the bottom of the screen is where you issue directives. It's a bridge between the abstract nature of language and the direct manipulation of the digital world.

### 2. Coherence

Creation is not free. Every action you take—analyzing a project, manifesting an object—costs **Coherence**. This resource, displayed in the top-left corner, represents your focus and creative energy. If it depletes, you must pause and recenter before you can continue building. This system introduces a strategic layer to the development process, encouraging thoughtful action over chaotic haste.

### 3. Project Analysis & Build Simulation

This is the core functional power of Reality Command. It allows you to take a conventional software project and process it through our holographic engine.

*   **Analysis (`analyze project`):** Initiate the process and a holographic portal appears, prompting you to submit your project's source files.
*   **AI Core:** A powerful Genkit-based AI analyzes the file structure, dependencies, and configuration to understand its architecture and devise an optimal build plan.
*   **Build Pipeline:** The AI's plan is then visualized as a holographic build pipeline, showing each stage (Setup, Dependencies, Build, Run) executing in sequence.
*   **App Manifestation:** Upon successful completion, the application is "manifested" as an interactive holographic icon (🚀).

### 4. Wave Transmission

Manifesting the app isn't the final step. To bring your creation from the conceptual plane to your local machine, you interact with the manifested app icon. This initiates a **wave transmission**, condensing the AI-generated build plan into a practical shell script (`.sh`) and transmitting it to your machine as a downloadable file.

### 5. Object Manifestation & The Physical Builder

This is where the vision truly takes shape. Beyond building from files, you can directly sculpt the reality of the application space. Using the `manifest <shape>` command, you can conjure primitive geometric objects (`cube`, `sphere`, `pyramid`) into the environment. These are the foundational building blocks for a future where an application's UI is not confined to a rectangle, but can be sculpted into any form imaginable.

### 6. Meditation Mode

"Coherence flows through contemplation." When your creative energy is low, issue the `meditate` command. The interface will shift into a focused, contemplative state. In this mode, your Coherence is passively restored, allowing you to return to your work refreshed and refocused. To exit, simply click anywhere on the screen.

## How to Use Reality Command

The interface is driven by simple, intuitive commands:

*   `analyze project`: Begins the process of analyzing a software project. A file dropzone will appear.
*   `manifest cube` / `sphere` / `pyramid`: Creates a holographic object in your AR space.
*   `meditate`: Enters Meditation Mode to restore your Coherence.

## The Vision: True Holographic Interaction

This prototype is the first step. It establishes the foundational language and mechanics for a new kind of creative tool. We are moving toward a future where developers are not just coders, but architects of digital reality.

Thank you for being a part of this journey.
